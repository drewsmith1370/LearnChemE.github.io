This is the hydraulic loss virtual laboratory, an experiment in which we will use manometers to understand frictional losses of pressure in pipe flow. On the left, we have a 1000 mL beaker filled with water that has been dyed red, and submerged in the water is a pump and valve that will push the water through this apparatus in the middle. The apparatus has four manometers, each spaced 7.62 cm apart. On the right is a waste beaker that the liquid will drain into. There is a button in the top-left, where you can download the word document containing the directions to this laboratory by clicking "worksheet".

To turn the pump on, click the on/off switch in the top-left. As you can see, water is not flowing through the tube because the valve is closed. So we will open the valve about halfway, and now we can see the water flowing through the apparatus. Each of the manometers now has a liquid height corresponding to its pressure. To measure the height of the liquid, we can drag this ruler in the top right to one of the manometers and zoom in using the scroll wheel, then move the image by dragging the mouse on the canvas. Zoom back out using the scroll wheel, and let's press the reset button to start a new trial. When you press the reset button, the valve will stay in its current position so that you can perform multiple trials at the same flow rate. I'll turn on the pump, and water will start flowing again. We can pinch the tubing by clicking where it says, "click to pinch". When I pinch the tubing, the height of the liquid in the manometers drops to zero, and bubbles start flowing through the apparatus.

To tilt the apparatus such that the water is flowing with gravity, press the tilt button in the top-right. If you ever encounter an issue with the simulation, just refresh the page, and if the problem persists, inform your instructor. That's all you need to know, good luck with the lab.
